# Labs 1 and 2 â€” Command Line
I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.  
  
For Labs 1 and 2, I demonstrated performing various commands on the command-line interface.
I used Windows Terminal and Windows Subsystem for Linux on my school laptop to complete the lab.

## Assignment
![hostname to env](./hostname_to_env.png)  
  
![ps to cd demo](./ps_to_cd_demo.png)  
  
![nano file](./nano_file.png)  
  
![cat file to clear](./cat_file_to_clear.png)  
I purposely did not enter the `clear` command.
In the later screenshots,  you can see the effects of the command and how it cleared the terminal screen though.  
  
![man uname](./man_uname.png)  
  
![uname -a to netstat](./uname_-a_to_netstat.png)  
  
![Other commands](./other_commands.png) 
I purposely did not enter the `sudo shutdown -h now` command for obvious reasons
